Python compiles and runs code real-time via CPython

Python ia a multifunction(functional and object oriented) interpreted language
Java is a compiled object oriented language
Compiler converts code intro machine code or c code permanently - interpreter compiles it dynamically via 'interpreting' it to lower languafges'
